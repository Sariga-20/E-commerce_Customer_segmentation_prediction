This application analyzes e-commerce customer data to create meaningful segments and predicts which segment a customer belongs to based on their purchasing behavior.
This project uses **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** for feature engineering, **K-Means clustering** for segmentation, and a **Random Forest model** for prediction.

        Here are the business-oriented descriptions for each customer segment identified by the model:

        - **Champions:**
          - **Who they are:** Your best and most valuable customers. They have purchased recently, buy often, and spend the most.
          - **RFM:** High Frequency, High Monetary, Low Recency.
          - **Strategy:** Reward them. Offer loyalty programs, exclusive access to new products, and build a strong relationship. They are your brand advocates.

        - **Loyal Customers:**
          - **Who they are:** Consistent buyers who spend a good amount. They are responsive to promotions and are the backbone of your business.
          - **RFM:** High Frequency, Good Monetary, Low Recency.
          - **Strategy:** Engage them with up-selling opportunities. Ask for reviews and leverage their loyalty.

        - **Potential Loyalists:**
          - **Who they are:** Recent customers with average frequency and spending. They have the potential to become Loyal Customers or even Champions.
          - **RFM:** Average Frequency, Average Monetary, Low Recency.
          - **Strategy:** Nurture them with personalized offers and build a relationship. Encourage them to purchase more frequently.

        - **At-Risk Spenders:**
          - **Who they are:** Customers who used to spend and purchase often but haven't been back in a while. They are at risk of churning.
          - **RFM:** High/Average Frequency & Monetary, High Recency.
          - **Strategy:** Win them back with personalized reactivation campaigns. Offer special discounts or remind them of products they've viewed.

        - **Lost Customers:**
          - **Who they are:** Customers with the lowest frequency and monetary value, who also haven't purchased in a very long time.
          - **RFM:** Low Frequency, Low Monetary, High Recency.
          - **Strategy:** While it might be difficult to re-engage them, a low-cost campaign could be attempted. Otherwise, focus efforts on more valuable segments.
